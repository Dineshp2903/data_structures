Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored

1.  Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.

2.  Interval Search: specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures Eg: Binary Search

Searching Algorithms :

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Jump Search
4. Interpolation Search
5. Exponential Search
6. Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list)
7. Fibonacci Search
8. The Ubiquitous Binary Search
9. Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
10. Recursive function to do substring search
11. Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)


Comparisons:

Linear Search vs Binary Search
Interpolation search vs Binary search
Why is Binary Search preferred over Ternary Search?
